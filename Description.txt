My project, titled "Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning," focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease 
in patients. This is crucial as cardiovascular issues are a leading cause of mortality worldwide.

I analyzed a comprehensive dataset using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, 
decision trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN and support vector machines, to identify the most effective model for this task. Ultimately,
I found that Logistic regression Model provided the highest accuracy in predicting whether a patient has heart disease. 

The implications of this work are significant, as early and accurate prediction can aid in timely intervention 
and potentially save lives. 
Moving forward, I plan to refine the model further and explore additional data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
